Traffic Simulation Manager Application Programming Interface
</center>


**TraSMAPI** can be seen as a generic API for microscopic traffic that allows real-time communication between agents of urban traffic management (such as vehicles and traffic signals) and the environment created by various simulators. This tool was developed in LIACC (Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science Laboratory), University of Porto.

This API offers a higher abstraction level than most of microscopic traffic simulators in such a way that the solution is independent from the microscopic simulator to use.

Currently, TraSMAPI can be used with [SUMO](https://github.com/STEMS-group/trasmapi-sumo), [AIMSUN](https://github.com/STEMS-group/trasmapi-aimsun) and [ITSUMO](https://github.com/STEMS-group/trasmapi-itsumo).
