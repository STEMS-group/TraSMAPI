**TraSMAPI** is a generic API used as bridge for microscopic traffic simulators [(what is a microscopic simulator?)](https://github.com/STEMS-group/trasmapi/wiki/Simulation-Models) that allows real-time communication between agents in the urban traffic context (such as vehicles, traffic lights and pedestrians) and the environment created by  various simulators. This tool was developed at LIACC (Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science Laboratory), University of Porto.

This API offers a higher level of abstraction than most microscopic traffic simulators, in such a way that the solution is independent from the simulator in use.

Currently, TraSMAPI can be used with [SUMO](https://github.com/STEMS-group/trasmapi-sumo), [AIMSUN](https://github.com/STEMS-group/trasmapi-aimsun) and [ITSUMO](https://github.com/STEMS-group/trasmapi-itsumo).
