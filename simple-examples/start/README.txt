Executing Main.java in this folder will start JADE and SUMO. This is a Guilherme Soares example. In this example SUMO will start with some cars being added to it as well as to JADE. Each car is an agent. A GUI window appears in order to stop and follow some cars. With a large amount of cars in SUMO this window usually crash the simulation. "TlMap" is the folder used to get the map.
